A deep learning–based coastline extraction algorithm was developed using a U-Net–structured semantic segmentation network to achieve end-to-end coastline detection from remote sensing imagery. 
The loss function incorporates Sobel edge detection, which enhances the model’s sensitivity to boundary gradients and improves delineation accuracy along the land–sea interface.
After training, the model demonstrates robust and consistent boundary detection performance in sandy beach environments, producing high-resolution binary segmentation results. 
Moreover, it also performs well in other coastal segments, maintaining reliable edge continuity and minimizing misclassification in complex coastal settings.
